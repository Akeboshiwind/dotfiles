# >> Set shell

# >> Set Colour mode

# This is one of those endlessly confusing things unfortunately
# These settings make little sense and are also very sensitive

# Here's how I tested if the changes worked:
# - I have a script `truecolor-test` in bin
#   - Run that and you should see a continuous line of colours
#   - `truecolor-test --width 30` was about the minimum I could
#     see blocks
#   - What I observed was that the background of two adjacent
#     characters was *clearly* the same
# - Run `echo -e "\e[3mfoo\e[23m"` to see if italics work
#   - "foo" should be output in italics

# As of tmux 2.1 if the terminal is "screen" or "screen-*"
# then tmux will disable italics.
# So this can be set to anything that doesn't begin with "screen"
set -g default-terminal "xterm-256color"

# This is also required for italics
# I'm pretty sure what this does is tell tmux to interpret
# `\E[3m` as sitm Which according to `man terminfo` means
# `enter_italics_mode`.
#
# For some reason the ",xterm*" bit doesn't have to match
# default-terminal and I have no idea why. Might as well make
# them match for now
# NOTE: -a means append
set -sa terminal-overrides ',xterm*:sitm=\E[3m'

# Since version 3.2, tmux added the RGB feature to add support
# for truecolour.
set -sa terminal-features ',xterm*:RGB'
