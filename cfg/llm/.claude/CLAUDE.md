# Plan Mode

- When writing plans, be extremely concise. Sacrifice grammar for the sake of concision.
- At the end of each plan, list unresolved questions. Ask about edge cases, error handling, and unclear requirements before proceeding.
- End every plan with a numbered list of concrete steps. This should be the last thing visible in the terminal.
