# Dotfiles

My personal dotfiles repo managed using [home-manager](https://nix-community.github.io/home-manager/)

See [here](./home-manager/README.md) for setup info.



## Philosophy

The main philosophy is **simplicity**, in particular I've decided this means:
- A folder for each application
- Loose coupling between applications
- Be declarative
- Use the application's native config files
- Split config into multiple files where possible
- Comment liberally
- Use application defaults most of the time
