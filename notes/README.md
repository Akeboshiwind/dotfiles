# notes

Notes is a simple commandline based note taking application. It uses the
UNIX philosophy and is built ontop of existing tools which should mean
less lock in.

There isn't a brew package for this project so I've included the
project as is.

The project url is: https://github.com/pimterry/notes

I believe the version currently included is v0.4.3 but I'm not sure
seeing as they don't have a --version command yet.

## Dropbox Sync

The current setup for notes is to use dropbox to sync the files.

Dropbox seems to need to be configured manually which is a shame but it's fairly painless to setup.
