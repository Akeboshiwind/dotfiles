# >> Python Setup

This python setup is fairly opinionated.

As I see it there are two things to manage in a python project:
- The version of python the project uses
- The dependencies for that project (ideally in a separate environment)

To accomplish these goals I use `poetry` to manage deps, and `pyenv` to manage the python version.



# >> Setting up a new project

Can't remember tbh :sweat_smile:, if you've gotten this far I'd read into `pyenv` I remember it being easy enough :)
