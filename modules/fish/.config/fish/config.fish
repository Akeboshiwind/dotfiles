# I think this works but I'm not 100% sure
# Basically, asdf shims weren't being picked up (`java -version` was erroring)
# I *think* what was happening was that the shims were being added too late
# Possibly $fish_user_paths is messing up the path order?
# If so I'm not sure what I can do for that other than banning fish_set_path
# Maybe wrap it so that asdf shims are always used?

# >> Note to future me: asdf shims broken
# tags: asdf, shim, java

# If you accidentially exit tmux completely then restart it, for some reason the asdf shims to to the back of the PATH
# This means they get overshadowed by /usr/bin.
# The solution is: Just restart Alacritty.
# Not really sure why ðŸ¤·
