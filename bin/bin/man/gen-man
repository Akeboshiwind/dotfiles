[description]
\'gen-man\' uses \'help2man\' to generate a manpage output to stdout. Looks in
~/bin/man for files to include using the -i option in \'help2man\'. If no file
is found then the standard \'help2man\' output is generated.
.br
Depends on \'help2man\'.

Notes:
.br
Included files must end in a newline if you dont want two sections to merge
unexpectedly
