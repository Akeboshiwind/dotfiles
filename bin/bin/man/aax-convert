\'aax-convert\' converts files from the \'aax\' file format so another format
using ffmpeg.
.br
Depends on \'ffmpeg\' and \'pass\' and assumes you have your amazon activation
bytes stored at \'personal/amazon.co.uk\' under a key called \'activation-bytes\'
in your password store.

Notes:
.br
The activation bytes can be found using the following tool:
https://github.com/inAudible-NG/audible-activator.
.br
The tool only needs to be used once then the activation-bytes can be saved
somewhere (like a password manager) and used in this script.
