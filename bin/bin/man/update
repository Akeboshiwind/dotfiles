\'update\' is an idempotent script which installs a list of packages and
uninstalls those that aren\'t on the list. On first run spacemacs will be
installed as well as defaults for osx will be set.

Searches for packages to install in \'~/bin/pkgs/brew\' for brew and
\'~/bin/pkgs/cask\' for cask, these can be overidden with the options
\'--brew-pkgs-folder\' and \'--cask-pkgs-folder\' respectively.
